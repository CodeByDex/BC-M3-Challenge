# Password Generator
This is a repo used as part of a coding bootcamp. 

## What
This is a simple web app that will generate passwords of various length and character compositions based on user request. 

## How
You use this app by answer a series of prompts describing what you want your password to contain. 

You could modify existing eligible characters in passwords by modifying the arrays.

If you wanted to add additional character types you would need to create the addition prompts and then implement the characters in the generatePassword and validatePassword methods. 

you can validate if the passwod is generating as expected by using the test array (and ensuring it contains characters not found in the valid character lists).

This is a sample program used for learning Java Script but could be used by anyone that needs a simple password generator as well.
